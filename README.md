## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the Computer Security Lab offered to CSE students in the Monsoon 2023 semester. The lab is designed to provide hands-on experience in key areas of computer security, including cryptography, network security, and vulnerability analysis.

## Lab Experiments

### Secured GroupChat
In this experiment, we delve into the implementation of a Secured GroupChat application. The focus is on understanding and implementing SSL from scratch using cryptographic primitives. Students will gain insights into the principles of secure communication and encryption.

### Network Security
This experiment explores Network Security concepts through the use of Scapy. Students will learn about packet manipulation and demonstrate a practical understanding of network attacks, including ARP poisoning. The experiment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of network-level security threats and countermeasures.

### Buffer Overflow
The Buffer Overflow experiment focuses on understanding vulnerabilities in C and C++ programs. Students will work with a vulnerable program where a malicious script is inserted into a susceptible buffer. This leads to gaining control over the program's execution, demonstrating the importance of secure coding practices.

## Getting Started
To get started with the lab experiments, follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Kali Linux (highly recommended)
